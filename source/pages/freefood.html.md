Everyone knows that college/university tuition is absurdly high in the US (as
well as many other countries). If I were to give one piece of advice to current
and future college students, it would be to take advantage of all the free
opportunities you can find.

Most schools have a sizable budget they set aside for school events for
students, such as social events and speaker talks. Since they often span a
large variety of topics, there are bound to be a few that interest each
student. In addition, some of them also offer **free food**!

So, as a student myself at Northwestern University, I decided to make [NU Free
Food](http://nufreefood.seanyeh.com), an automatically generated listing of
events around campus that offer free food. If you're a student at Northwestern
University, you won't have to go hungry ever again!
