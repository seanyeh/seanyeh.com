### Introduction

I've recently been getting back into contributing to open source software, and
I almost forgot how daunting exploring a huge, unfamiliar codebase can be.
Being able to make sense of someone else's code is a difficult skill, one that
is almost never covered in the standard computer science curriculum.

This made me realize (*again!*) that, despite having spent half my life working
on technology, I really still have much to learn. Now that it's holiday season,
I've decided to spend these few days to catch up with an old and neglected
friend: **reading**.


### Hello, <s>World!</s> Books!

Back in high school, one of my favorite things to do was to check out the
"computers and technology" book section for some new reading material. I
remember reading books of all kinds of topics, from Java Servlets and
Networking to Ethical Hacking and XML. Of course, I didn't understand a large
portion of what I read, but I was hungry for knowledge and learned a lot
from the little I did.

Just yesterday, I stopped by the local library and checked out a few books. One
brand new book caught my eye: *A Philosophy of Software Design* by 
[John Ousterhout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ousterhout), the creator of the 
[Tcl scripting language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcl).
I may share some of my findings if I find them interesting enough :)
