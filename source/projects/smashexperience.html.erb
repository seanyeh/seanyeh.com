        Smash, the Multimedia Experience
    </h2>

    <p>
    First started in 2017, <i>Smash, the Multimedia Experience</i> is an ongoing
    series of multimedia performances experimenting with my skills with
    technology, interest in video gaming, and a desire for increasing audience
    interest and engagement  &mdash; all combined into an interactive multimedia
    experience. The video game used in these performances is
    <i>Super Smash Bros. Melee</i>, although I do have plans of incorporating
    other games in the future as well.

    <h3>
        How it works
    </h3>

    <p>
    Before the performance, audience members use their phones to log onto a
    web app I've developed.  This app allows them to play the game through
    their phones, essentially like a game controller.  Each round, 4 people are
    selected to play the game, which is projected onto the large screen on stage.

    During all of this, I perform the background music from the game. It's tons of fun!
