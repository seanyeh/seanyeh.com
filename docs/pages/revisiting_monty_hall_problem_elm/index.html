        <h2 id="monty-hall-variant">Monty Hall Variant</h2>

<p>I came across the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem">Monty Hall Problem</a>
again the other day, and thought of a variant to the original problem: what if,
after the player chooses the initial door, the host opens a door randomly? Now, if
the host accidentally opens the door with the car, then the problem becomes
pointless. But, let's say that if the host opens a random door, <strong>given</strong> it's
a goat, is it still advantageous to swap choices? This is a case of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_probability">conditional probability</a>,
and I suspect that this is part of the reason why the solution to the original
problem seems so counter-intuitive.</p>

<p>It turns out that this variant (among many many others) has been discussed
before, and the consensus is that the chance of winning becomes 50-50. However,
I still went ahead and built a simulation to see the results for myself.</p>

<h2 id="first-steps-in-elm">First steps in Elm</h2>

<p>I took this opportunity to dive into a programming language that I've been
interested in for a while: <a href="http://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a>. After a quiet 2 years
(almost) of no major releases or posts on their official blog, Elm finally came
out with version 0.19 last month.</p>

<p>Despite having some experience with functional programming languages (OCaml,
Lisp), I initially found it challenging to wrap my mind around some
of the concepts in Elm, such as subscriptions, commands, and
<a href="https://guide.elm-lang.org/effects/random.html">random number generation</a>.
I also have noticed that, as of this writing, a <strong>lot</strong> of resources online are
outdated, including <a href="https://elm-tutorial.org">https://elm-tutorial.org</a>,
making the learning process a bit more difficult.
(Even all the <code>elm</code> build commands have changed!).</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I was able to get through the basics, and wrote the
<a href="https://seanyeh.github.io/monty-elm/">simulation</a>.
I look forward to working with Elm more in the future!</p>
