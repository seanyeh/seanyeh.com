<h3 id="introduction-curl-and-wget">Introduction: curl and wget</h3>

<p>Most developers know that <strong>curl</strong> has more features than <strong>wget</strong>, but for any
task involving downloading files, wget seems to be the most popular.
Why is that?</p>

<p>Well, it really boils down to the defaults. While the author of curl has
<a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2014/11/17/why-curl-defaults-to-stdout/">explained</a>
his design choice, curl defaults to <em>printing to stdout</em> whereas wget defaults to
<em>saving to a file</em>. Naturally, people will take the path of least resistance, and
prefer <code>wget</code> over <code>curl -O</code>.</p>

<p>I bring this example up because, despite the intentions of the authors, users
tend to use the tools in whatever way works best for them.</p>

<h3 id="touch">Touch</h3>

<p><img src="/pages/youre_doing_it_wrong_unix_tools/man_touch.png" alt="touch man page" /></p>

<p>According to the man page, <strong>touch</strong>'s main purpose is to <em>change file timestamps</em>.
When was the last time you used it that way? I can confidently say in my decade
and a half of using unix tools, I have only had to do that <strong>once</strong> (and it was
for a shell programming homework assignment).</p>

<p>Under "description" in the man page, it says:</p>

<p><code>Update the access and modification times of each FILE to the current time.</code></p>

<p>and then</p>

<p><code>A FILE argument that does not exist is created empty, unless -c or -h is supplied.</code></p>

<p>Aha! Interesting that what seems like just a side effect (creating an empty
file) has become the most common use case.</p>

<h3 id="cat">Cat</h3>

<p><img src="/pages/youre_doing_it_wrong_unix_tools/man_cat.png" alt="cat man page" /></p>

<p>It is conventional wisdom that <strong>cat</strong> is used to print out files to
stdout because cat stands for…con<strong>cat</strong>enate? Huh?</p>

<p>Imagine you were to write a function that takes in strings and returns the
concatenation of all of them. A mindful developer would take into account <em>any</em>
number of inputs, including zero and one input, but a beginner (or
lazy) developer might not. From this problem description, it would seem like
inputs of zero or one strings are <strong>edge cases</strong>.</p>

<p>Strange how for <strong>cat</strong>, concatenating <em>one</em> file is its primary use case!</p>

<p>The man page for cat says it will <em>concatenate files and print on the standard
output</em>. However, most people use it to simply print the contents of <em>one</em> file
to stdout, which has led to using cat to chain commands,
e.g. <code>cat file | grep "hi"</code>.</p>

<p>This idiom is so common that people have even written about
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_(Unix)#Useless_use_of_cat">Useless Use of Cat</a>
and the <a href="http://porkmail.org/era/unix/award.html">Useless Use of Cat Award</a>!</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Despite the title of this post, I think it's perfectly fine to use the tools in
anyway you need. In fact, I would say these tools are the easiest to use for
the functions I've mentioned above (which I use all the time). I just
find it quite fascinating to see how in both <strong>touch</strong> and <strong>cat</strong>, the intended use
has been neglected (or even forgotten) because of a more useful side effect.</p>

<p>In the case with <strong>cat</strong>, I find there are benefits with the "useless" use.
Conceptually, chaining simple commands through pipes is much easier than
remembering which argument is for the input file. Also, when building a more
complicated command, I like to visually see the output step-by-step. And with
the only con being…spawning an extra process? It's okay, I'll stick with my
current
<a href="https://xkcd.com/1172/">workflow</a> :)</p>
